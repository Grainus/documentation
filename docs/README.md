# Atlas Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for [Atlas](https://atlas.bot)! Here you can find guides and detailed information on ~~all~~ most functionality Atlas has. We're working towards cleaning up and simplifying these guides, so if you find issues or get confused come tell us in our [support server](https://atlas.bot/support) so we can improve things for everyone.

They're also open source, so if you want to contribute to this documentation you're welcome to [submit a PR](https://github.com/sylo-digital/documentation)
